    #### The primary goal for this website, which is going to be called LDA Creps, is to target adults, teenagers and mid-teens, they would be the main target audience as around that age they would be wanting to buy new shoes for when going out in holiday, for people who want to have the latest shoes.

* User Goal
    
    1. The goal for this project is to allow the audience to be able to buy different varieties of shoes from Nike and Yeezy. Which have a different colour and style.

    2. The website hopes to have around 2 to 4 pages so the audience would be able to explore what is available. 

    3. To add multiple images showing how the shoe looks, from different angles, so the audience has a better look and understanding on what they are looking at. 

* LDA Creps Sneaker website.
    1. LDA Creps will have a smooth design so the audience would be able to move around perfectly through the pages.

    2. LDA Creps is a great website as it would have different shoes from Nike to Yeezy, giving a small description on how it looks and potentially a background of the shoe.

    3. The overall feel of LDA Creps website is going to be easy to navigate and have an easy user interface.

* Parental Goals
    #### Parents of the users are not to be worried as this website is going to be child friendly and would have a very straight forward user interface, which allows younger teens and teenagers to manoeuvre around without having to go through a lot of trouble. 

    1. All images which are shown are child friendly.

    2. The appearance of the website will be professional, showcasing a good high standard is being met.

    3. This website would also showcase what makes a shoe valuable where that is by a collaboration or by how much stock there is for a pair as not all pairs values aren't the same.

    #### LDA Creps will be user meet all these needs because :


* Developer and  Business Goals
    #### Business Goal
    1. The goal for the business is to attract as much attention so the audience would be able to have a look around the website and see what type of shoes are available, they are many different pairs from two well known brands. 

    2. The goal for this business will also be to show as many images of the shoe that are available, so the audience will be able to have a better look of the shoe when browsing the website.

    3. The goal for this business is to make sure the audience / customer is having a good interaction with the website, taking them where they need to go, making sure they are having a good experience when on the website. 

    #### Developer Goal

    1. The goal as the developer is to make animation occur when the customer is scrolling down the home page. 
    
    2. The goal as the delelopmer is make sure all images are clear and give it a smooth friendly cover, so it can look nice and presentable. 

    3. The goal as the developer is to make sure all links are attached correctly as I do not want any broken links which will cause an error if there are incorrect links attached.

    #### As the younger and older participant would be taking part in the raffles, i would want :

    1. The website is going to be designed in a way which would not be too complicated, so they would be able to manoeuvre around the website.

    2. The website would contain many different shoes from Nike to Yeezy, this means the customer would have a variety of shoes to choose from instead of one to keep them interested.

    3. My website would also contain some form of showing that the customer is hovering over a button, as if they do , then the button would start to have a dark shadow over it and if they don't then it would appear as normal. 

    #### As a parent of participant, i want :

    1. I would like them to be shoes which are different styles from each other, not having the same style and the same colour, i would like them to be kept engaged with the website.

    2. I would like them to be button specific parts such as viewing the shoe.

    3. I would like the overall look of the website to look appealing so it keeps them interested, meaning they browse the website for longer for anything that they are interested in. 

* Design Choice
    #### Colours

    1. The primary colour that I have chosen for the website is a white background however it will contain a small percentage of other colours to give it a nice look. The colour I have chosen for the logo, titles and text is going to be black, so it would be clear for the target audience to see.

    2. Some text will contain a colour which would have some glow in order to make it have a fancy look.

    #### Font
    1. The font that is going to be used is Rubik Font. The reason I have chosen this font is because of how it looks, gives a friendly feel and is very simple to read.

    #### Styling

    1. The styling i have chosen for this website is quite simple, beside a image, there would be text alongside it and this would go throughout the whole website, however it would change if clicked on the Nike page, which would have a title at top, an image of the shoe in the middle and price at the bottom. 

    #### Images
    1. I have chosen images of shoes, however each shoe is different from each other in order to target female and males. 

    2. I also chose images of shoes to make the audience feel the purpose of the website, which is the latest streetwear shoes.

* Wireframes
    #### I have made a powerpoint explaing how the website would like and the function of each button.

## Features
#### The types of features that I have included in this project is some animation with some numbers, the way this would work is by the amount of product that would have been sold, when scrolling down the home page, the animation would start as it would have a trigger when a customer is scrolling down the page. The number will start at 0 but then later on start changing to a different number.

#### Another feature that i have used is bringing the navbar down whenever the user is scrolling down the page, the reason for this is because it would make it a lot easier for the user to have the navbar down at all times so instead of the user scrolling al the way back up, they can just click on the navbar which is down, making it much easier to go to another page.

## Area Of Improvements
#### After implementing everything and reviewing the website, i saw that i have missed a couple areas such as adding “ALT” to buttons and images, “ALT” is used for describing the function of a certain feature on the website, an example would be an image, it would describe the appearance of the image for people who are blind.

#### This would be an area where I would need to improve on the website as this would make it difficult for people with disabilities.

3. JS

## Testing
* The types of browser i have tested the website is on :

1. Internet Explorer
2. Google Chrome
3. Opera

* Within all these three browsers which have been tested on, they were the only ones which could contain the website functioning pretty well, whereas the other browser had some difficulty forming the layout of the website correctly. There was some issues with Internet Explorer however it wasnt big of a difference but there some slight movement within the website, what i mean by this is by certain things where not in the correct place.

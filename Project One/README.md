# Project One 

## UX

* Project Goals
    #### The primary goal for this website, which is going to be called LDA Creps, is to target adults, teenagers and mid-teens, they would be the main target audience as around that age they would be wanting to buy new shoes for when going out in holiday, for people who want to have the latest shoes.

* Audience Goal
    
    1. The goal for this project is to allow the audience to be able to buy different varieties of shoes from Nike and Yeezy. Which have a different colour and style.

    2. The website hopes to have around 2 to 4 pages so the audience would be able to explore what is available. 

    3. To add multiple images showing how the shoe looks, from different angles, so the audience has a better look and understanding on what they are looking at. 


* Players Goals
    1. LDA Creps will have a smooth design so the audience would be able to move around perfectly through the pages.

    2. LDA Creps is a great website as it would have different shoes from Nike to Yeezy, giving a small description on how it looks and potentially a background of the shoe.

    3. The overall feel of LDA Creps website is going to be easy to navigate and have an easy user interface.
